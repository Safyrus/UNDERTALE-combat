# NES UNDERTALE Combat

## About The Project

This is an attempt at recreating the **UNDERTALE combat** system for the **NES**.

This project also contain another project:
A **demake** of all the **UNDERTALE OST** using the **NES MMC5** mapper.
You can find the project [here](data/undertale.fms).
You will need [FamiStudio](https://famistudio.org/) to open it.
Also, I'm no musician, so I'm sure there are mistakes here and there.

## Downloads

### Nightly build

Somewhere at the root of the repo (for now).

- [Combat ROM](Undertale.nes)
- [Music ROM](Undertale_music.nes)

## Emulators

I recommend playing it on the [Mesen](https://www.mesen.ca/) emulator
because it's the emulator that I use to test & debug the game on,
so it should work fine.
It is also the most accurate emulator that I know
(I can't think of developing on the NES without all of these debugging features).

## Compile

### Prerequisite

- Make
- [CC65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65): An 6502 C compiler uses to create the binary file used by the NES and the Emulator
- Python with all the necessary packages:
  - argparse
  - Pillow
  - numpy
- [FamiStudio](https://famistudio.org/): If you want to edit the musics

### Commands

Note: You may need to change some configs in the Makefile to be able to run commands.

| Commands    | Description                  |
